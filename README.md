Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

      Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.
      It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
  

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

      Mastering process
      Mastering communications
      Mastering productivity
      
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

      Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
      Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
      Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
      Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
      Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
      Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
      
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

      Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
            - there is Low flexibility,
            -changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
            - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
            - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

      Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
            - High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
            - Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
            - Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

      


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.





Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.




2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
